# Alarm_Clock
Folder Structure:
-The project contains 3 files: index.html, style.css, and index.js.

The index.html file contains the HTML code that creates the structure of the web page.
The style.css file contains the CSS code that styles the web page.
The script.js file contains the JavaScript code that adds the functionality to the web page.
HTML Code:
The HTML code contains a simple structure that consists of a heading, a clock section, an alarm section, and a footer section.

CSS Code:
The CSS code is responsible for the styling of the web page. The CSS code is used to make the web page look visually appealing and easy to use.

JavaScript Code:
The JavaScript code is the backbone of this project. It is responsible for adding functionality to the web page. It creates a clock that updates every second, and it allows the user to set an alarm.
Finally, we implement the functionality using javascript. We do this in the following steps:

Create Initial References
Append zeroes for single digit
Search for value in the object
Display time
Display time(with zeroes appended)
Create alarm div
Set alarm
Start Alarm
Stop Alarm
Delete Alarm

Features:

The clock section displays the current time in a 12-hour format and updates every second.
The alarm section allows the user to set an alarm by selecting the hours, minutes, and AM/PM using dropdown menus.
Once the user sets the alarm, a countdown timer is displayed on the screen.
When the countdown timer reaches zero, an alarm sound is played to alert the user that the alarm has gone off.
Conclusion:
This alarm clock project is a simple yet effective example of how JavaScript can be used to create interactive web pages. It showcases how JavaScript can be used to manipulate the DOM and create dynamic content. The project can be extended by adding new features like the ability to snooze the alarm, or to save alarm settings for future use.
